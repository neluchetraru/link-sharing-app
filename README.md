# Link-sharing app - share your social media links with the world!

This is my solution to the [Link-sharing app Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/linksharing-app-Fbt7yweGsT) from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

The application was created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Demo

You can try the application [here](https://link-sharing-app-jade.vercel.app), or run it [locally](#getting-started).

## Features

- Complete link sharing app built with NextJs 14
- Share social media links with others
- Clean, modern UI on top of shadcn-ui
- Authentication using [Kinde](https://kinde.com/)
- 100% type safety achieved with TypeScript
- Picture upload using [uploadthing](https://uploadthing.com/)
- Handling forms with [@tanstack/react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/installation)

## Getting started

To run this project locally, run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neluchetraru/link-sharing-app.git
cd link-sharing-app
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

It is neccessary to copy *.env.sample* file into *.env.local* before running the application locally, then fill in the necessary variables with your own.
The website will now run on ```http://localhost:3000```
